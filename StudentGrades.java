 * REQUIREMENTS - ITC155 MIDTERM 
 * Problem 2: 
 * Given a HashMap pre-filled with student names as keys and grades
 * as values, complete main() by reading in the name of a student, 
 * outputting their original grade, and then reading in and outputting 
 * their new grade.
 * 
 * Ex: If the input is:
 * Quincy Wraight
 * 73.1
 * 
 * the output is:
 * Quincy Wraight's original grade: 65.4
 * Quincy Wraight's new grade: 73.1
